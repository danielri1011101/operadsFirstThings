\section{}

The free operads of Baez are obtained via $C-$trees, where $C$ is a
\emph{collection}.

\begin{defn}
	A \emph{$C-n-$tree} is a planar $n-$tree such that each vertex
	with $k$ children is labeled by an element of $C_k$.
\end{defn}

\section{}

The identification of phylogentetic trees with the operations of
$\mathrm{Com} + \Rsemi$ is thanks to the following theorem in
\cite{baezOtter}:

\begin{thm}\label{bo40}
	If $O$ and $O'$ are operads such that $O'$ has only unary
	operations, then there is a bijection between $(O + O')_n$ and
	equivalence classes of $(O,O'_1)-n-$trees such that no unary vertex
	is labeled with $1_O$ and no internal edge is labeled with
	$1_{O'}$.
\end{thm}

\subsection{} The equivalence relation considered in theorem \ref{bo40} is
the one given by the \emph{natural} way to permute labeled rooted trees,
namely respecting ``genealogy'' or, more formally, its \emph{partial order
structure}.

\section{Comments}

\subsection{} The definition of \emph{operad} in \cite{baezOtter}
coincides with that of May in \emph{Geometry of iterated loop spaces}.
Namely, it is a symmetric operad in the symmetric monoidal category of
topological spaces. With the exception that more than one 0-ary operations
are allowed.

\subsection{} The forgetful functor

$$
U : \mathrm{Op} \to \mathrm{Top}^\NN
$$

is natural because operad maps are degree-preserving.

\subsection{} Operad maps are defined by preserving the commutative
diagrams of operads, and being continuous\footnote{Read May in case there
are topological or otherwise considerations I'm ignoring.}.
