\section{TODOs and more}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Include Operad composition picture.
	\item Define Haskell listing manually. \texttt{<-- couldn't.}
	\item \texttt{splitForest} is a \emph{pseudoinverse} to \texttt{Cons}.
		Can't say it's an inverse because types don't match. But maybe
		that can be worked around later.
\end{itemize}
