\section{}

Decided on the following short-term plan to implement phylogenetic trees as a
coproduct of operads:

\subsection{} Understand the operations of $\mathrm{Phyl}$ as $\Rsemi-$labeled
$\mathrm{Com}-$trees, as in Theorems 9 and 40 of \cite{baezOtter}.

\subsection{} Modify the \texttt{MoveTree} type from the tic-tac-toe backend to
have the trees labeled with real numbers instead of game moves.

\subsection{} Use Milewski's definition of coproducts to obtain a map

\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{Com} \ + \ \Rsemi \ \to \ \mathtt{PhylTree}
\end{equation}

and prove it to be an isomorphism.
