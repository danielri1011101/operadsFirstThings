\section{}

The comonad defnition as a typeclass is

\lstinputlisting[language=Haskell, firstline=48, lastline=50]{DocCode.hs}

And in Milewski's tic-tac-toe, \emph{the evaluator} will be a comonad insntance,
apparently. This evaluator defines a tree-to-vector behavior:

\lstinputlisting[language=Haskell, firstline=59, lastline=59]{DocCode.hs}

The ``obvious'' way in which this can be made into a functor doesn't occur
to me. I must review \emph{record syntax} (lyahfgg) and universally quantified
types (Pierce).
