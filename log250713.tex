\begin{itemize}

	\item All relevant \emph{code} written. Now dealing with compilation

\section{Type signatures and function evaluations}

\bigskip
\bigskip

\subsection{}

The type signature of the \texttt{splitForest} function is

\lstinputlisting[language=Haskell, firstline=17, lastline=22]{DocCode.hs}

\bigskip
\bigskip

And the evaluation of its recursive case is given by

\lstinputlisting[language=Haskell, firstline=23, lastline=34]{DocCode.hs}

\bigskip
\bigskip

this can be visualized in the following picture:

\subsection{} 

The signature of the \texttt{Operad} typeclass is

\lstinputlisting[language=Haskell, firstline=9, lastline=11]{DocCode.hs}

\bigskip
\bigskip

And our instance of interest is the type \texttt{MoveTree}, which is
parametrized by the \texttt{Nat} kind. Its signature is coupled with
that of \texttt{Trees}, also parametrized by \texttt{Nat}. These signatures
are

\lstinputlisting[language=Haskell, firstline=1, lastline=7]{DocCode.hs}

\bigskip
\bigskip

Therefore, the main challenge in making move trees an operad instance is
defining the \texttt{compose} function, especially in the recursive case.

\bigskip

Here's an overview of the instantiation:

This depicts the composition arguments:

And this is a scheme of the composition's result:
