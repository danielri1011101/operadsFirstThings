\section{}

The identification of phylogentetic trees with the operations of
$\mathrm{Com} + \Rsemi$ is thanks to the following theorem in
\cite{baezOtter}:

\begin{thm}
	If $O$ and $O'$ are operads such that $O'$ has only unary
	operations, then there is a bijection between $(O + O')_n$ and
	equivalence classes of $(O,O'_1)-n-$trees such that no unary vertex
	is labeled with $1_O$ and no internal edge is labeled with
	$1_{O'}$.
\end{thm}
