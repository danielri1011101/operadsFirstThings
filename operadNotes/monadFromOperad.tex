\section{}

Let $f$ be an operad\footnote{Over the category $\mathcal{C}$ used by May: differential
$\ZZ-$graded $k-$modules.}, and for each object $X$ let $X^j$ denote its $j-$th tensor
power. Then, let $\mathtt{f} : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}$ be given by

$$
\mathtt{f}\ X = \bigoplus_{j \geq 0} f(j) \otimes_{k[\Sigma_j]} X^j
$$

\subsection{Tensor product over non-commutative rings.} The definition of the monad associated to
an operad involves tensor product over the group ring $k[\Sigma_j]$, which is non-commutative.
I will write down what I think the definitions should be\footnote{After confirming these, I will
hopefully also add some \emph{motivation} for their use.}.

\begin{defn}
	If the ring $k$ is commutative, then there is no distinction between left- and right-
	modules. Therefore, the tensor product $A \otimes_k B$ of two $k-$modules is defined as
	$$
	k^{\oplus A \times B}/W,
	$$
	where $W$ is the sub-module generated by the elements
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		(a+a', b) - \left( (a, b) + (a', b) \right) \\
		(a, b+b') - \left( (a, b) + (a, b') \right) \\
		x(a, b) - (xa, b) \\
		x(a, b) - (a, xb).
	\end{eqnarray*}
	Then, we let $a \otimes b$ denote the equivalence class of $(a, b)$ in this quotient.
\end{defn}

However, if we let $R$ denote an arbitrary ring\footnote{Rings for us are fixed to have $1$, for
the more general case we use the term \emph{algebra}.} and we let $T$ denote some set, then the
``direct sum'' $R^{\oplus T}$ can only be guaranteed to make sense as an abelian group, since the
left- and right- module structures need not coincide.

\begin{defn}
	Let $R$ be a non-commutative ring, $A$ a right $R-$module, and $B$ a left $R-$module.
	Define their \emph{tensor product over $R$} as
	$$
	A \otimes_R B := \ZZ^{\oplus A \times B}/W,
	$$
	where $W$ is the subgroup generated by the elements
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		(a+a', b) - \left( (a, b) + (a', b) \right) \\
		(a, b+b') - \left( (a, b) + (a, b') \right) \\
		(ar, b) - (a, rb) \\
	\end{eqnarray*}
\end{defn}

In the case where the non-commutative ring $R$ contains a ``nice'' commutative ring $k$ as a
subring ---as in differential operators and group rings---, the tensor product is defined as the
quotient of the free $k-$module modulo the analogous submodule. Explicitly, the relations for
$A \otimes_{k[G]} B$ are those of $k-$bilinearity and

$$
(ag, b) - (a, gb),
$$

where $A$ is a $k-$module with a right $G-$action and $B$ is a $k-$module with a left $G-$action.

\section{Questions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item What is $R \otimes_R R$ when $R$ is not commutative?
	\item What is the defining mapping property of the abelian group $A \otimes_R B$ when $R$
		is not commutative?
\end{itemize}
