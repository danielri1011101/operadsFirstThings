\section{Comments}

\subsection{} Let's say we have a category $\mathcal{C}$ on which we
regularly do ``operaton-like manipulations''. Then we may expect the
objects of $\mathcal{C}$ ---or some of them--- to be algebras of some
operad. Is this the \emph{raison d'etr√®}?

\subsection{} Thm 23 of \cite{baezOtter} describes the free operad $F \ C$
of a collection.

\subsection{} Is he saying that the left adjoint to the forgetful functor
is the free operad functor?

\subsection{} Seems like for Baez' trees, the target map isn't injective
in the cases one cares about.

\subsection{} Drawing these trees vertically is what makes the distinction
between source and target meaningful.
