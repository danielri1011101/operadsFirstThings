The comonad defnition as a typeclass is

\lstinputlisting[language=Haskell, firstline=48, lastline=50]{DocCode.hs}

And in Milewski's tic-tac-toe, \emph{the evaluator} will be a comonad insntance,
apparently. This evaluator defines a tree-to-vector behavior:

\lstinputlisting[language=Haskell, firstline=59, lastline=59]{DocCode.hs}

The following typings follow:

The type of \texttt{runW} is

\lstinputlisting[language=Haskell, firstline=67, lastline=67]{DocCode.hs}

And that of \texttt{W} is

\lstinputlisting[language=Haskell, firstline=71, lastline=71]{DocCode.hs}

Also, \texttt{ghci} gives the following answer when asked for the kind of
\texttt{W}:

\lstinputlisting[language=Haskell, firstline=77, lastline=78]{DocCode.hs}

Since a \texttt{Comonad} is also a \texttt{Functor}, we must first make a
functor out of \texttt{W f}. For this, we first make \texttt{Vec n} into a
functor via

\lstinputlisting[language=Haskell, firstline=80, lastline=82]{DocCode.hs}

And then \texttt{W f} with

\lstinputlisting[language=Haskell, firstline=84, lastline=88]{DocCode.hs}

Now, to obtain a \texttt{Comonad} instance, we must define the \texttt{extract}
and \texttt{duplicate} maps. The first one is

\lstinputlisting[language=Haskell, firstline=90, lastline=91]{DocCode.hs}

Given the functor he has defined, as well as the \texttt{extract} function
above, one would expect the type of his \texttt{duplicate} to be

\lstinputlisting[language=Haskell, firstline=93, lastline=93]{DocCode.hs}

A naive function that typechecks is

\lstinputlisting[language=Haskell, firstline=102, lastline=106]{DocCode.hs}

Where the \texttt{replycate} function takes a value \texttt{b0} and a
vector of length $n$ with type-\texttt{a} coefficients and produces a vector
of the same length with $n$ copies of the value \texttt{b0}:

\lstinputlisting[language=Haskell, firstline=97, lastline=99]{DocCode.hs}

This (hopefully) suffices to make \texttt{W f} a naive instance of the
\texttt{Comonad} typeclass:
