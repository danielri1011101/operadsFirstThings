% Secure safe _random_ access to a vector?

% That seems to be the purpose of *Fin*

% Tab character warnings...

% _let_ bindings ("outside I/O", if you want) are *local*
  in scope (say, to ease declaring a function), because
  VARIABLES DON'T EXIST!

% Indeed, _let_ bindings in ghci are local as well, because their
  scope is the one and only _main_ function!

% Does the DataKinds import allow for the definition of "new kinds"? Namely,
  is in this tictactoe the data Nat **only** a kind?

% Yeah, so Matrix _can_ recieve Nat arguments because Matrix is defined in
  terms of Vec, which is parametrized by Nat from its definition.

% Making trees into an operad instance is the code written right before
  _The Comonad_ section. Namely, it takes some work.

% The _grade_ of a tree gives its number of inputs.

% The example of the existential quantifier suggests to me that constraints
  point towards the usefulness of (say) refinement types, and towards how can
  Haskell become/include a (mathematical?) proof checker (as noted by Milewski).

% Makes perfect sense to call upon addition's associativity in order to recover
  a splitting of Forest f m n...
